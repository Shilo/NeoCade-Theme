# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** A drop-in Godot 4.6 dark Theme resource at `res://addons/neocade_theme/neocade_theme.tres` that styles every built-in Control to a `godot-minimal-theme` bar of feature-completeness, with arcade-inspired neon visual identity, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), universal across editor + runtime + all 6 Godot export targets, with a sibling `neocade_mobile_theme.tres` mobile-tuned variant.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — visual-direction-mockup-approval-gate

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (visual-direction-mockup-approval-gate) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project init (2026-05-04): Mobile variant elevated to v1 must-have alongside desktop primary; cross-platform support across all 6 Godot export targets locked as v1 must-have.
- Research synthesis (2026-05-04): SUMMARY.md Conflict 1 revised — ship Outfit Variable in v1 as display/marquee font; defer Inter Italic to v1.x; net bundle smaller (~1.85 MB) and more on-brand.
- Research synthesis (2026-05-04): SUMMARY.md Conflict 2 — adopt M3 5-stop tonal surface ramp as canonical with friendlier aliases (base/secondary/panel/raised/overlay); reject `surface.sunken` for v1.
- Research synthesis (2026-05-04): SUMMARY.md Conflict 3 — no drop shadows in v1 (GL Compat over-renders shadow alpha per Godot #23640); elevation conveyed via tonal surface ramp only; `shadow_size = -1` on every StyleBoxFlat.
- Roadmap (2026-05-04): 11-phase structure adopted from SUMMARY.md verbatim; mockup approval gate is hard blocker between Phase 3 and Phase 4; token-sharing strategy is `@tool` script generator (not `.tres` inheritance).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 1 Plan 01 (2026-05-04): Dissection skeleton MINIMAL-THEME-DISSECTION.md committed with SHA-256-pinned provenance, verbatim helper bodies, and runtime-validated line citations — Plans 02/03 unblocked.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 1 Plan 02 (2026-05-04): Per-Control enumeration appended to MINIMAL-THEME-DISSECTION.md — 80-token Active Verification Audit + 25 user-facing class sections + 3 NeoCade-additive sections (MenuBar/Panel/Window) + 1 combined container-chrome section + Pitfall 1.7 evidence anchor; 225 enumeration rows total; D-08 reconciliation surfaces 3 user-facing classes upstream does not theme.
- Phase 2 verification (2026-05-04): LDtk source mining passed UAT with 5/5 checks, 0 issues; LDtk coverage is HIGH for v1 UI-theme research, with source outputs explicitly non-binding inspiration for Phase 3 mockups.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- **UD-5 (real-device cross-platform testing matrix):** User hardware/account status for Android devices + Mac + Apple Developer Program is unknown. Decision needed before Phase 10 plan is authored: confirm available test surfaces, identify gaps, decide whether v1 ships with full mobile coverage or with "verified on Windows/macOS/Linux/Web; mobile-targets pending real-device QA in v1.0.1."
- **UD-1 (MCP server swap):** Current Coding-Solo `godot-mcp` lacks screenshot capture; QA phases require it. Recommended swap to GoPeak (`npx gopeak`) addressed in Phase 3 sub-spike but should be confirmed before Phase 3 starts.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Typography | Inter Italic Variable bundling | Deferred to v1.x (Conflict 1 revision; synthetic italic transform used in v1) | 2026-05-04 |
| Fonts | CJK Noto Sans bundling (~30 MB) | Deferred to v2 / opt-in (UD-2 default; README documents override) | 2026-05-04 |
| Color modes | Light color mode (desktop + mobile) | Deferred to v2 | Project init |
| Palettes | Alternate palette variants (magenta, amber) | Deferred to v2 | Project init |
| Editor | Editor-only theme types (FlatButton, MainScreenButton, etc.) | Deferred to v1.x | Project init |
| Accessibility | Deeper VoiceOver/TalkBack/AccessKit screen-reader QA | Deferred to v1.x (UD-6; `accessibility_name` only in v1) | 2026-05-04 |
| QA | Real-device Android + iOS validation | Conditional on UD-5 resolution; v1 may ship with "deferred to v1.0.1" note | 2026-05-04 |
